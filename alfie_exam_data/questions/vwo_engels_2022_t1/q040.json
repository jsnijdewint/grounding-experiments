No such link was seen with a range of other blood measurements.<br><br>[b] In several experiments, participants who had eaten a low-carb meal earlier in the day were more likely to accept unfair offers in the game than those who had eaten a high-carb meal. In one experiment, 76 per cent of low-carbers accepted an unfair offer compared with 47 per cent of a high-carb group.<br><br>[c] In theory, people should always accept, but in practice, people often reject low offers. We seem to have an urge to punish those who split the money unfairly, even if we suffer a small loss, says Park.</p>"
