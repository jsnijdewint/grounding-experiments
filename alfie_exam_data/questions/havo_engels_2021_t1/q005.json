    "text": "<p>Which of the following letters presents the same argument as Steve McMahon uses in his letter?<br>A Letters defending private schools or even portraying them as agents for social mobility must surely be part of the new trend for fake news? The headmistress of James Allen's Girls' School gives us a heartrending account of the struggles of her mother sending her off to private education on the back of her work in the school kitchen. She probably has few pupils in her school with mothers currently in such employment. Finding the upwards sum of an extra £10k a year from the wages of a kitchen help would be laughable.<br>Joan Errington,<br>East Grinstead, West Sussex<br><br>B Promoting social mobility through public schools being seen as positive is in itself problematic. In an unequal society someone climbing the social ladder sends someone down. Greater social equality, without rank being set by those already privileged, would enable all people being respected for their abilities and contribution to society.<br>Roy Grimwood,<br>Market Drayton, Shropshire<br><br>C When I attended James Allen's Girls' School (Jags) in the 1950s at least half the pupils post-11 were paid for by the local authority. The remaining half had to pay fees. There was some genuine social mobility with many girls going on to successful careers. But nowadays Jags is a part of the very small but extremely powerful private sector in this country. It is naive to think that schools that are so richly resourced and as selective as Jags enhance social mobility.<br>Liz Armstrong,<br>Hadfield, Derbyshire</p>",
